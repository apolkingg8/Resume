/* EXAMPLE USE:

 GOOD using variable:
 @media all and (max-width: @tabletWidth) {
   body {

   }
 }

 BETTER with embedded media queries:
 body {
         @media @tablet {
                 background: #000;
         }
 }

Better is subjective. Embedded media queries do increase file size, but we are probably talking about 20 kilobytes per site. With compression, I would prefer a more readable, more object oriented (everything related to an HTML node is next to each other). If the CSS got too large, I would recommend breaking it into separate files and loading it in modules.
